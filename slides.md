# Malachi 3:1--4:4
“See, I am sending my messenger to prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple.
The messenger of the covenant in whom you delight—indeed, he is coming, says the <sc>Lord</sc> of hosts.
Then I will draw near to you for judgment\.\.\.\. 
For I the <sc>Lord</sc> do not change; therefore you, O children of Jacob, have not perished.
Ever since the days of your ancestors you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them.
Return to me, and I will return to you, says the <sc>Lord</sc> of hosts. But you say, ‘How shall we return?’...
Then those who revered the <sc>Lord</sc> spoke with one another.
The <sc>Lord</sc> took note and listened\.\.\.\.
They shall be mine, says the <sc>Lord</sc> of hosts, my special possession on the day when I act\.\.\.\.
Then once more you shall see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him\.\.\.\.
Remember the teaching of my servant Moses, the statutes and ordinances that I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel.” 

<!--
* In this section of Malachi, God is dialoging with his people about their past failures and the coming day of judgment.
    * There is a lack of direction in the responses to God's recounting of unfaithfulness, i.e., "How shall we return?" "How have we robbed you?" "How have we spoken against you?" 
* Nevertheless, God asserts that a return to faithfulness will be met with blessing (v. 10).
* Return to the teaching of Moses is key; unity within the nation will be spurred on by the influence of Elijah (Mal 4:5).

# Early Jewish Sectarianism
## Qumran, Sadducees, Pharisees

<!--
* Sources are tricky.
    * We basically have Josephus, Qumran texts, the New Testament, and Mishanah/Tosefta as potential witnesses to help us understand early Jewish sectarianism.
* These groups are not institutional, but rather voluntary associations.
    * No sectarian movement has any inherent power or authority over the people, the temple, or the priesthood.
    * These are parties in the sense that they are organized to promote a certain view of life and practice.

# E. P. Sanders: “I know a good deal less about Pharisaism than has been ‘known’ by many investigators.”

# According to Jesus, the problem with the Pharisees is not that they are “strict”!

<!--
* According to the Pharisees' critics, they are too lenient!
* According to Qumran, the Pharisees are "seekers after smooth things/easy interprerations."
* Jesus's problem with the Pharisees is that they adopt lenient policies for the sake of observing purity, but then also neglect "weightier matters."
