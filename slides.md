# According to Jesus, the problem with the Pharisees is not that they are “strict”!

<!--
* According to the Pharisees' critics, they are too lenient!
* According to Qumran, the Pharisees are "seekers after smooth things/easy interprerations."
* Jesus's problem with the Pharisees is that they adopt lenient policies for the sake of observing purity, but then also neglect "weightier matters."
