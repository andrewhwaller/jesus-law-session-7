# According to Jesus, the problem with the Pharisees is not that they are “strict”!

<!--
* According to the Pharisees' critics, they are too lenient!
* According to Qumran, the Pharisees are "seekers after smooth things/easy interprerations."
* Jesus's problem with the Pharisees is that they adopt lenient policies for the sake of observing purity, but then also neglect "weightier matters."

# How does Jesus engage in early Jewish debates around Torah observance?

<!--
* To state the obvious, Jesus is not the first person to interpret biblical law.
    * As we saw last week, the question "how shall we return?" is very much live in early Judaism. 
    * There are multiple competing conceptions of what Torah observance looks like and what it means to be faithful to the covenant.
* Jesus enters into these ongoing conversations about Torah observance.
    * Jesus isn't the only person stressing Israel's need to remain faithful to God's law.
    * On the other hand, neither is Jesus suggesting a radical break with the Torah.
* Jesus has a particular perspective to contribute to this conversation as a partcicipant alongside his contemporaries.
    * This doesn't lessen the importance and centrality of Jesus's perspective for Christian understandings of the law.
    * Rather, it helps us understand how Jesus, even as the divine author of the Law, also approaches the Law and conversations about the Law as a faithful Israelite.

# Matthew 12:1-8
“At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the sabbath; his disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
When the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, ‘Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the sabbath.’
He said to them, ‘Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
He entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him or his companions to eat, but only for the priests.
Or have you not read in the law that on the sabbath the priests in the temple \[profane\] the sabbath and yet are guiltless?
I tell you, something greater than the temple is here.
But if you had known what this means, “I desire mercy and not sacrifice,” you would not have condemned the guiltless.
For the Son of Man is lord of the sabbath.’”

<!--
* Stating this up front: My understanding of this passage has been greatly helped by Paul T. Sloan's SBL 2023 paper on Jesus's halaka in Matt 12. Shout out PTS.
