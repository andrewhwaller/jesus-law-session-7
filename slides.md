# Malachi 3:1--4:4
“See, I am sending my messenger to prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple.
The messenger of the covenant in whom you delight—indeed, he is coming, says the <sc>Lord</sc> of hosts.
Then I will draw near to you for judgment\.\.\.\. 
For I the <sc>Lord</sc> do not change; therefore you, O children of Jacob, have not perished.
Ever since the days of your ancestors you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them.
Return to me, and I will return to you, says the <sc>Lord</sc> of hosts. But you say, ‘How shall we return?’...
Then those who revered the <sc>Lord</sc> spoke with one another.
The <sc>Lord</sc> took note and listened\.\.\.\.
They shall be mine, says the <sc>Lord</sc> of hosts, my special possession on the day when I act\.\.\.\.
Then once more you shall see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between one who serves God and one who does not serve him\.\.\.\.
Remember the teaching of my servant Moses, the statutes and ordinances that I commanded him at Horeb for all Israel.” 

<!--
* In this section of Malachi, God is dialoging with his people about their past failures and the coming day of judgment.
    * There is a lack of direction in the responses to God's recounting of unfaithfulness, i.e., "How shall we return?" "How have we robbed you?" "How have we spoken against you?" 
* Nevertheless, God asserts that a return to faithfulness will be met with blessing (v. 10).
* Return to the teaching of Moses is key; unity within the nation will be spurred on by the influence of Elijah (Mal 4:5).

# “How shall we return?”
# How are Jews in the Second Temple period answering this question?

<!--
* Remember that the biblical law is like a traffic code: it tells us the principles of law, but it doesn't tell us how people are actually driving.
* Biblical law is not a complete system, so we need to look at how people are interpreting and practicing it.

# “Common Judaism”
## Mosaic law, Sabbath/feasts, circumcision, *kashrut*, ritual purity.

# Early Jewish Sectarianism
## Qumran, Sadducees, Pharisees

<!--
* Sources are tricky.
    * We basically have Josephus, Qumran texts, the New Testament, and Mishanah/Tosefta as potential witnesses to help us understand early Jewish sectarianism.
* These groups are not institutional, but rather voluntary associations.
    * No sectarian movement has any inherent power or authority over the people, the temple, or the priesthood.
    * These are parties in the sense that they are organized to promote a certain view of life and practice.

# E. P. Sanders: “I know a good deal less about Pharisaism than has been ‘known’ by many investigators.”

# The portrayals of other early Jewish groups in the Gospels/Acts are *rhetorically shaped*.

# Qumran

<!--
* Community in the Judean desert that produced the Dead Sea Scrolls.
* Believed the Jerusalem priesthood to be corrupt and distanced themselves from the Temple.
    * Because the community is now the center of worship, the *yahad* takes on some of the properties and functions of the Temple.
* Conflated the boundaries between ritual and moral purity, with certain sins resulting in temporary exclusion from the community or pure food.
* Believed themselves to be keeping covenant with God on behalf of the nation and that someday Israel would return to the covenant and join them.
* Similar to Christianity in some ways, especially the language of a non-physical temple made up of humans, and various other messianic and eschatological beliefs.

# Sadducees

<!--
* Relatively small group, but associated with the Jerusalem priesthood.
* According to Josephus (Ant. 13), accepted only the Torah as authoritative and rejected any other rules or traditions.
    * This seems to be specific to *legal observance*, i.e., Josephus shouldn't be read as implying that they denied all other scripture.
* According to Acts 23, "the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, or angel, or spirit; but the Pharisees acknowledge all three."
* Vanderkam, 190: "What appears to be the case is that the Sadducees and the Qumran sectarians adhered to a conservative, strict approach to interpreting and applying the law of Moses, an approach that may well have been one maintained and transmitted in priestly circles."

# Pharisees

<!--
* A larger and more popular group than the Sadducees.
* Still not an institutional group, but a voluntary association.
* The Pharisees had a different take on purity.
    * They emphasized the self as the locus of purity, rather than the Temple (Furstenberg, 83).
    * In order to allow for a practice of purity throughout daily life, the Pharisees adopted an accessible policy of "nonseparation" (Furstenberg, 83).
        * Instead of the stricter policy of separation from impurity, the Pharisees alllowed for a lenient approach.
        * This expands biblical ideas about purity and modifies the separation between pure/impure in biblical law.
* The Pharisees observed "the traditions of the elders," which are described as such because they are not in biblical law.
    * Sometimes the Pharisees are accused of "adding to the law," but they are actually careful to distinguish between the law and the traditions.
* This is counterintuitive to us.
    * We see more rules as being more strict or more burdensome.
    * It's important to remember that the Pharisees are trying to enable an accessible purity in daily life.
    * Instead of the stricter and more defined sort of separation that we find in biblical law, there is a seemingly more complicated but still permissive form of purity that allows for everyday circumstances without demanding strict separation.

# Matthew 23:25--26
“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!
For you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup, so that the outside also may become clean.”

# m. Kelim 25:6
“\[Parts of a vessel\] upon which \[impure\] liquids fell—one dries them, and they are pure\.\.\.\. A vessel whose exterior was rendered impure by liquid—its exterior is impure. Its interior rims, handle sockets, and handles \[remain\] pure. But if its inner part becomes impure the whole is impure.”

# m. Yadayim 4:7
“The Sadducees say: We complain against you, Pharisees, for you declare a liquid stream pure.”

<!--
* We might also think of Jesus's critique in Mark 7, where his basic charge is that the Pharisees permit binding oaths that cause a violation of the biblical law to honor parents.

# According to Jesus, the problem with the Pharisees is not that they are “strict”!

<!--
* According to the Pharisees' critics, they are too lenient!
* According to Qumran, the Pharisees are "seekers after smooth things/easy interprerations."
* Jesus's problem with the Pharisees is that they adopt lenient policies for the sake of observing purity, but then also neglect "weightier matters."
